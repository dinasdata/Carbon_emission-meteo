# Climate Trends in Analamanga (1993‚Äì2022)  

This repository analyzes historical climate data for Madagascar's Analamanga region, focusing on **rainfall, temperature, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions** from 1993 to 2022. The project explores trends, correlations, and predictive modeling using visualized datasets.  
The meteorological parameters dataset is issued from the national weather service of Madagascar with a reanalysis data, the carbon dioxyde emission dataset is from www.climatewatchdata.org.
## üìä Plots Overview  

1. **Rainfall Distribution**  
   - Annual rainfall variability with no clear long-term trend.
   - The mean value observed in 30 years is 1096 mm,which is considered as the normal rainfall value of the region.
   - The standart deviatio is 222 mm,that means rainfall for the region is not very stable.
   - The minimal value observed is in 2006 which is related to 623mm of rainfall, and the maximum value is located in 2015 with a value of 1692 mm, related to a great flood in the region
   -Rainfall for the region is decreasing by 1.17 mm per year, but statistical test tells that rainfall is not related with years with a correlation coefficient value of -0.045. 
   -  Potential influences: Monsoon cycles, ENSO, and local topography.

2. **Temperature Trends**  
   - Stable annual averages (18.0¬∞C‚Äì19.4¬∞C) with minor fluctuations.  
   - No sharp warming/cooling, suggesting regional climate resilience.  

3. **CO‚ÇÇ Emissions vs. Temperature**  
   - Weak visible correlation between local CO‚ÇÇ and temperature.  
   - Global vs. local factors may explain the disconnect.  

4. **Rainfall vs. CO‚ÇÇ Emissions**  
   - No direct relationship found; rainfall likely driven by oceanic-atmospheric cycles.  

5. **CO‚ÇÇ Prediction Model**  
   - Fitted vs. observed emissions show close alignment, suggesting a robust forecasting approach.  

## üîç Key Insights  
- Local CO‚ÇÇ emissions do not strongly correlate with temperature or rainfall changes in Analamanga.  
- Temperature stability contrasts with global warming trends, possibly due to regional buffering effects.  
- Rainfall patterns remain variable but without significant directional shifts.
